# MACM day 2 Basic Counting Principles

## Summary
If you choose something or another thing how have (something + another thing) choices. If you choose both, you multiply both choices. If you have a permutation with repeating elements, you need to get rid of some of those repeats. This is done by dividing by how many `repeats!` because the repeats will have `repeats!` combinations within itself.

### Rule of Sum
To preform either of the task, it is done m+n way

### Rule of product
To preform both of the task, it is done m*n way

### Permutations with repetition
**(n/(k1,k2,...kn))**
