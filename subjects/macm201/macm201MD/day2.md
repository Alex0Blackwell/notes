# Class 2

## Summary

## Terminology

alphabet
- set of n elements called letters

String
- ordered sequence of n letters from the alphabet

permutation
- Every letter of the alphabet must be there exactly once

simple graph
- no loops

adjacent
- edge from vertex a->b

degree
- number of adjacent vertices

complete
- all possible edges, no loops

path
- sequence of vertices, must be distinct

cycle
- must come back to the first vertex

connected graph
- path in **G** from any vertex **i** to any vertex **j**
- can go from any vertex to any other vertex

disconnected graph
- can not get to every vertex from any other vertex

tree
- connected and has no cycles
- minimum number of edges while still being connected
- same tree if the structure is the same. We don't care about the vertex labels

isomorphic
- Having a similar structure or appearance but being of different ancestry.



### Sets and subsets

How many ways can we choose ...
***Choosing n elements is the same as choosing (removing) |S|-n***
