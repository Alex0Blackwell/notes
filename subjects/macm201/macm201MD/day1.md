# MACM day 1
Introduction to the course

## Summary
The questions on the midterm will be like the questions on the assignments. Draw pictures, many different ways to get the same solution.


## Review
Calculus: **Derivativees** and **Integrals**
- Both have notations

But we're doing discrete mathematics: **Sums** and **Products**
- Sigma, product notation (big pi)
