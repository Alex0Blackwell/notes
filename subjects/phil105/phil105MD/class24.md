# PHIL 105 - Last Class!

When we compared plants that are fed super plant grow to ones that aren't, we found taht 70% of the SPG plants grew tall, whereas only 10% of the others grew tall.

We conclude that SPG makes plants grow tall.

Consider, however, gene x is making better photosynthesis causing plants to grow tall.
Gene X also makes the plants look sick which causes plants to be fed SPG.
So the Gene is making it look sick while also making the tree grow tall.

### Randomized controlled trial
SRS for experimental group and control group then give the SPG to the experimental group.

## New Confounding Factors
Needs to be a blind test.
Can't have placebo (beliefs and expectations).
This test would be "double blind" because the doctor can't know and the patient can't know.
