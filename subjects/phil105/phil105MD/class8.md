### Exam
units 1-2-3-4

## Notes
100% = 1
50% = 50/100 = 0.5
0% = 0

Chance of A: P(A)
P is probability
A is an event or statement (not a number)

F-outcomes
`------`
total possible outcomes

### Chance vs odds
*Chance*
A outcomes **in** total outcomes

*Odds*
A outcomes **to** non-a outcomes

### Conditional probability
P(B | A)

P(shark death) = 6 / 7,500,000,000
P(shark death | surf) = greater

P(shark death | the shark is in water) = 6 / 7,500,000,000
This does not influence

0 and 1 are reserved and special
