# PHIL 105 - Implication/Conditional logic

## Summary
Conditional statements have an if or a when word in them. They can come in three equivalent forms. The antecedent is sufficient for the consequent and the consequent is necessary for the antecedent. Denying the consequent is a useful argumentation strategy.

## Conditional
At is a sentence, not a statement.

**if** [they havent died] **then** [they're still alive today]

**if** [antecedent] **then** [consequent]

The conditional is any way of presenting the antecedent and consequent.
A conditional *always* has both.

The antecedent is sufficient (it is enough for the consequent).
The consequent is necessary for the antecedent.

Can write it in different ways.

`if = when`

**if** [antecedent] **then** [consequent]
= [consequent] **if** [antecedent]
= [antecedent] **only if** [consequent]

#### only if
emphasizes necessity. but equivalent.

You may purchase alcohol if you're at least 19

This doesn't say that a 16 year old can't buy alcohol.

We're going to walk home unless we find a gas station soon.

We're going to walk home
**if** we do **not** find a gas station soon

A unless B = A if not(B)

### Syllogisms with conditional

if F then G

F
therefore G
*Affirming the antecedent* Invalid

G
therefore F
*Affirming the consequent* Valld

#### Contrapositive
if F then G

if not G then not F

If F then G

not F
therefore not G
*Denying the antecedent* Invalid

not G
therefore not F
*Denying the consequent* Valid

##### Only if

Im not taller than 2m only if im taller than 1m.

Im not taller than 2m
therefore im not taller than 1m
*Denying the antecedent* Invalid
= im not not taller than 1m
= im taller than 1m

Im not taller than 2m
therefore im not taller than 2m
*Denying the consequent* Valid

### DC for objections

Bob thinks god exists, Abby thinks God does not exist

Bob's objection:
*Abby's conclusion has to appear in the argument as an antecedent*

**if** [god does not exist] **then** [there wouldn't be a universe]
there is a universe

therefore god exists
*This is a valid DC argument. Abby has to reject one of the premises*

Abby's objection:
*Bob's conclusion has to appear in the argument as an antecedent*

**if** [god exists] **then** [there wouldn't be pointless natural suffering]
there is pointless natural suffering

therefore god does not exists
*This is a valid DC argument. God has to reject one of the premises*
