# PHIL 105 - Analogies and Samples

The world anti-doping agency made an error in deciding not to ban the use of hypoxic tents by athletes.
Using a hypoxic tent is not like altitude training. It’s
cheating. You can see that from the important similarities to
blood-doping, which is clearly cheating. They’re both
artificial ways of boosting red blood cell counts - someone
had to invent them. And they’re both just sneaky, contrary
to the “spirit of sport” that makes competition meaningful.

Is the tent so similar to blood doping?
*Example*
->| Your body adapts in the tent, blood doping is making your body change

## Samples

We have a population and we look at a sample.
This way we can save ourselves the trouple of looking at the entire population.

Phone addiction is real -- and so are its mental health risks

With the rise of social media, phone addiction has become common,
claim psychologists at Gotham University. Addicts use their phone
compulsively even when it's bad for work, school, or relationships.
By surveying first-year students in psychology and philosophy classes
at GU in the Fall term (n=800), the researchers determined that 22% of
first-year university students are smartphone addicts.

#### Sample size
An increased sample size increases the accuracy of what the population is.

#### Precision and Accuracy
Precision is about the exactness.
Accuracy is about the truth.

More precise statements are more inaccurate.
