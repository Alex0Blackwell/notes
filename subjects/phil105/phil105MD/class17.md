# PHIL 105 - Fallacies

### Ignoring an explanation
Hypothesis:
There is a rain god who controls the weather

Prediction:
If I do the rain dance then it will rain and there is a rain god.

We do the rain dance in Vancouver in November and it rains.

There is another explanation that just says it's because weather.


### Not precise enough
Saturn Return
On your saturn return (age 27-31) expect major life changes or transistions.

But there is another explanation that says that's just when people settle down.

A: Some financial hassles ahead for you.
B: In six weeks your nephew steals your wallet and buys $740 of video games from best buy

B is much more precise.

If B was to happen it would be much more interested.
If A happens we don't really think too much of it.

This is a fallacy about not being precise enough.

### Confirmation Bias
Only looking for confirming evidence
Cherry picking evidence.
Asymmetrical updating

We are eager to be persuaded by information that aligns with our beleifs and reluctant to accept information that goes against it.

## Ad Hoc explanation
An excuse to why a prediction didn't happen.
