### Scientific Reasoning
Not just for science.

Abby works at the Rollercoaster casino in Luckyville. Going
through the day’s buy-in records, she’s surprised that someone
bought $800,000 of chips with $20 bills. “Wow,” she thinks.
“That’s a lot of cash.”

“I wonder if this is a criminal, like a drug trafficker, laundering
dirty money!” She knows that criminals use casinos to get rid
of large amounts of cash that would attract attention at a bank.
Casinos give them a cheque when they bring back their chips.

“Wait, probably the Save-Our-Souls megachurch down the
road had a mega-bake sale fundraiser, and bet the money at
the Rollercoaster roulette table.” She’s never heard of drug
traffickers in Luckyville.

But she decides to investigate. She figures that if SOS had a
bake sale, there would be photos on Facebook, so she looks up
the SOS Facebook page.

What is Abby's **observation**?: Someone bought $800k of chips with cash.

Her answer is a hypothesis. *Not all hypothesis are not explanations.*
Her **hypothesis** are:
1_ This is a criminal, like a drug trafficker, laundering dirty money!
2_ The megachurch doen the road had a mega-bake sale

The **prediction** is:
There are bake sale photos on the SOS FB page.
The prediction isn't just something someone thinks is true, it's more of an expectation and there is a way to check it.

### Explanatory Hypothesis
Inference to the best *competing* explanation (IBE)

Why are young people having so little sex?
**observation**
In many western countries people are having sex later in life, with fewer people, and less often.
**non-competing explanations**
- decline in couplehood
- hook up culture, dating apps
- economic stress, careerism
- anxiety depression
- smartphones, streaming television
- lower rates of child sexual abuse
...

So it could be produced by many different factors

**observation**
A seal got an eel stuck up its nose
**competing explanations**
1_ A seal surprised an eel, and it accidentallly swam into the seal's nose
2_ A seal ate an eel and then regurgitated it the wrong way

*these are competing, one way an eel is going into the nose and one way the eel is going out.*

Alternative hypothesis
- cannot both happen

NOT(F and G)
P(F) + P(G) <= 1
