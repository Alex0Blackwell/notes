# PHIL 105 - Cause and Effect

Causal chain
A -> B -> C

Cattle vaccinated against rinderpest virus caused more giraffes

Cattle vaccinated
*prevents*
spread to wild wildebeest
*so*
more wildebeest
*prevents*
tall grass
*prevents*
fires
*causes*
more tall trees
*causes*
more giraffes

converging and diverging things is what makes these causal chains complicated.

## Explaining Difference
a -> b
b -> a
c -> a, c -> b
a b

common = shared

## Controlled Experiments
Children who play violent video games behave violently more often.
If there is data that shows that children that play violent video games behave more violently than children that don't.

The children that play is called the experimental group, the no violent video game group is the control group.

The independent variable is the children that play violent video games.
The dependent variable is the violent behaviour

So
vvg -> vb
vb -> vvg

there might also be a common cause
c -> vb, c -> vvg

there might also be no causal explanation at all
vvg, vb

**Confounding Factors** and alternative explanations
bullying -> plays violent VG, bullying -> violent behaviour
