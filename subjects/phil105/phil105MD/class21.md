# PHIL 105 - Unit 9 Generalizing from a sample

## Sample Selection

Issues:
1. Bad luck
2. Bad design

1. Can fix with more work (larger sample size)

2. We can usually tell if something is going to be an over or under estimate though.

## Biased Sample
Measured feature is more / less common among population items with sample feature.

## Random Sample
Using a lottery machine to pick people is random.

Selecting poeple born on the 1st of a month is non-random.
But this sample can still make a **strong** argument.

## Examples
***72% of selfie deaths are males***
Based on our sample (n = 259)

Falling off a roof while doing free running is more likely to get on the news than someone who got hit by a car while taking a selfie.
Males are likely to do stupid things.

***1 in 3 lottery winners go bankrupt.***
Could generalize to a population of people who become rich suddenly and unexpectedly without working for it.
But someone who is buying lottery tickets is probably bad with money already so we may have a biased conclusion.
