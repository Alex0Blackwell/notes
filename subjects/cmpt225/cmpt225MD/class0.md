# Class 0

## Overview
This is a document I have created before my CMPT 225 class has started.  
The purpose of this file is to ensure the automated notes system is working correctly. Another purpose, however, is to write down my expectations of this class this Fall.  


## Expectations
What I wish to learn:
- Algorithms and Data Structures
  - Mostly learn more about data structures because I find the algorithms come with a strong understanding of data structures

What I wish to accomplish:
- "**A**" mark in the class
  - I enjoy my computer class and we had a bit of an upset last term but everyone loves an underdog victory :)
