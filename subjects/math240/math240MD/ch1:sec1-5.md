# Chapter 1: Linear Equations in linear algebra - The matrix Equation

## Summary
A homogeneous matrix equals zero. There is always at least one solution (the trivial solution) because Ax = 0 if x = 0.  

## Terminology

Homogeneous
- Ax = 0
- always has a solution because the x's can just be zero


If we have the same matrix but it isn't homogeneous, and instead equals a number, the span of this matrix is the homogeneous span but shifted.
