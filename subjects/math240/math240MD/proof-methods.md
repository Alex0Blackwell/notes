TFAE
- The Following Are Equivalent

## Reading a proof
Outline: suppose ... is a solution to ... show it is obtained from ... and a solution to ...

## Direct Proofs
Try right off the start.
A chain of implications leading from our assumptions to the desired statement

## Proofs by contraposition
p is a statement, then not p is the negation of p
eg) p: a is even, not p: a is not even

***contraposition: prove "p->q" by showing "not q -> not p"***

## Proofs by contradiction
Given a set of assumptions *A*, then we can deduce a statement *B*
So we assume that
- our assumptions A are all true
- *B* is false
and we prove that we can deduce that
- one asssumetion from *A*  is false

***In short: to prove that "If A then B", we can instead prove that "If A and not B then not A" which is a contradiction***
