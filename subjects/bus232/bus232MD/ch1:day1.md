# BUS 232 Looking at Data -- Distrubutions

## Summary

## Terminology
Distrubutions
  - Values taken by a variable and how often it takes them

Individuals
  - described by variables

Data Types
  - Categorical - groupings. Can be numbers but usually not.
  - Quantitative - we can do arithmetic. Numbers

Pareto Chart
  - Sorted bar chart

center
  - about half values above, half below

spread
  - look for values outside the overall pattern (outliers)

Symmetric
  - right and left sides are about mirrored

skewed
  - skewed to left -> left side longer from normal
  - skewed to right -> right side longer from normal

pth percentile
  - p percent of distribution falls below it.
  - 90 percentile of the class == top 10%

quartiles
  - first quartile = 25th percentile
  - median = 50th percentile
  - interquartile range: third quartile - first quartile

## Looking at Data -- Distrubutions

#### To better understand a data set

1. Who?
2. What?
3. Why?

#### Displaying categorical data

Purpose
  - summarize data to quickly get characteristics

Process
  - list categories

Methods
  - pie charts, bar graphs


#### Steps of making a histogram
*In our example:* max = 8.9, min = 1.5

1. **Estimate the value range** Assume max is 9, assume min is 0.0. Estimated Value Range = 9.0-0.0 = max - min = 0.
2.0
2. **Dividing the range into N classes** Let W = the width of each class. W = R/N. eg) let N = 9. W = 9.0/9 = 1; each class (9) has a width of 1.
3. Counting the frequencies. Make a chart with class, frequencies, and % frequencies as the columns.

#### Stem plot
- split by a magnitude of 10
- stem is to the left of vertical line. if extend the graph, add more of the same stems
- leaf is to the right of vertical line
- have to indicate leaf unit (leaf unit = 1)
- can round the leaf (trimming the dataset)


#### Describing distributions with numbers
***central values***
- mean - the average of all values - more effected by outliers
- median - the midpoint of a distribution - not very effected by outliers
  - arrange from smallest to largest
  - if odd, it's the middle
  - if even it's the mean of the middle two numbers

***measures of spread***
- range: largest-smallest
- interquartile range: third quartile - first quartile
  - third quartile get new median above median
  - first quartile get new median below median
  - less useful for small datasets
  - **boxplot** -- get the five number summary -- clearly show skewness
***measures of shape***

Coming up next... variance and standard deviation!
